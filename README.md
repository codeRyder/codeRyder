.hey@you (yeah you) 

.i\'m into web & app development for almost 20 years and my base is in landau, germany (yeeeah! brezel, wei√üwurst, oktoberfest! - no)

.i\'ll slam my keys with passion for modern tech stacks and agile work teams (kool and well-versed welcome)

.i love eco-systems driven by vanilla, vue, nuxt, node and other hot shit out there (that can compeed)

.cloud services, ci/cd and more more dev.ops stuff (some of them with those penguins)

.storyblok and everything that is topl... - headless! (no line stepper, swear i meant headless)
